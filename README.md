# TrafficLight
Made in 2 days using a Rasberry Pi 5 combined with Arduino Nano for managing a Smart Traffic light, both for cars and pedestrians
<br>
Time wasted: 14 hours
<br>
Neurons lost: I also lost the guys that were counting, so a lot.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## How can you replicate my code?
You need the following:<br>
* Rasberry Pi (you can use whatever, I used RPI 5 (8GB)
* Arduino Nano
* Colored LEDs, resistors, wires (Search for a Plusivo Kit - or buy its contents piece by piece)
